       "'DEMOGRAPHIC ASYMMETRIES 37 will be favorable and negative for the older countries. It is interesting to note the differences among the countries analyzed in the country studies of the book. Brazil and China are well ahead of India and South Africa in the demographic transition and, consequently, are expected to gain less from the FD. In comparing Brazil with China, in turn, we see that China’s drop in the support ratio will be faster than in Brazil, thus accelerating its arrival at the ageing state. As was mentioned earlier, Mason and Lee (2006a) sustain that the SD is associated with the fact that ageing populations have to provide for the oldage consumption of older persons who typically have substantially reduced labor income. In some cases, societies seek to meet this challenge by relying on transfer systems (either public programs or family support systems), but other societies increase their savings rates in order to accumulate wealth. In turn, if policymakers are forward looking, they will also strive to accumulate enough capital to support the social security system and accrue increased health expenditures for the old. Hence, to the extent that the anticipated life-cycle deficits during the ageing stage are satisfied by relying on capital accumulation, the result will be a permanent increase in the capital intensity of the economy and a permanent rise in output per worker. Is there evidence that the SD will not turn negative like the FD in the future? Mason (2005) provides evidence that supports the hypothesis of a permanent effect. Holding the transfer policy constant, so that the growth rates of the capital and life-cycle wealth 4 are equal, the SD is calculated to be positive for all regions and substantially larger than the FD for the period in question. In East and Southeast Asia, the SD was 1.31 percent per year in additional income growth—the largest of any region. It was also large in Latin America—1.08 percent per year. The assumption that capital accumulation and life-cycle wealth will move together, however, is probably too strong. The simulations in chapter 3 show that large differences between the velocity of asset accumulation and the velocity of increased life-cycle wealth can arise in the case of the four countries analyzed. The methodology developed in chapter 2, in turn, shows why the inconsistencies between asset accumulation and the demand for life-cycle wealth may give rise to unstable macroeconomic trajectories associated with unsustainable public debt or persistent macroeconomic disequilibria, such as excessive current account surpluses that in the case of systemically important countries like China can contribute to feeding global imbalances. On the other hand, Brazil’s analysis in this book indicates that a country can save too little during the window of opportunity. Large-scale pay-as-you-go pensions may undermine savings and work incentives. In addition, financial markets may not be sufficiently developed and may not provide the savings vehicles (mutual and pension funds, efficient professional investors) or the instruments to channel savings toward efficient investment in physical and human capital (Lee and Mason, 2010). The SD may be far more important than the FD because its effects are permanent, but they are also more responsive to policies and the structural'"
